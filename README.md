# graham-scan
There are two programs for presenting graham-scan algorithm which solves the convex-hull problem in O(nlogn).
Program1 : ConvexHullDisp.java
A example animation of graham-scan for the convex-hull
Program2 : hullModel.java, hullGUI.java, hullControl.java
A simple graphical presentation of graham-scan algorithm, with "step", "run", "reset". A practice of the MVC design pattern.
Entry point is hullControl.
